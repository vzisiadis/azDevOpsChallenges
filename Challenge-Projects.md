# Challenge 01 - Setup & Projects

## Introduction

DevOps is a very broad topic and you have lots of choices when it comes to the tools that you use. In this challenge you will setup your computer and cloud environment with the minimum required tools. 

## Description

In this challenge we will setup the core components needed to complete this What the Hack.

- Create an [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) Subscription that you can use for this hack. If you already have a subscription you can use it or you can get a free trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- Log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and confirm that you have an active subscription that you can deploy cloud services to.
- Log into [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/) using the **SAME** account as you use to log into your Azure Subscription and create a new project named `What The Hack Azure DevOps`. The project should be `Private`, use `Git` version control and an `Agile Work item` process ([hint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/user-guide/sign-up-invite-teammates))
   - HINT: Look under Advanced to select your version control and work item process. You cannot change these after you create your project. 
- Download and install [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/download) if you don't have it or a similar Git client installed
- Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) if you don't have it
- Create a new Azure DevOps project (suggested not to have empty spaces)
- Set up three iterations for the Project. Each iteration should start on Monday and ends on Friday (of the same week) with the first iteration starting this week.
- Create a new project team, add yourself as a member and invite a peer as member to the team. Assign all three project iterations to the team.
- View the new team's area path and iterations

## Success Criteria

1. You should be able to log in to the Azure Portal and the Azure DevOps Portal.
2. You have a DevOps project created which includes one additional team with two members.
